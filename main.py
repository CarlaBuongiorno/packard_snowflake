'''Mathematical snowflakes!
You get some graph paper, and some colored pens. 
 - Color in one square in the middle of the paper.
 - Then, in a different color, you color in every square that touches an existing square on only one side.
 - Then, in a different color, you color in every square that touches an existing square on only one side.
 - Then, but in a different color, you color in every square that touches an existing square on only one side.
 - Keep going

If you do this, you end up with some very pretty patterns.
This is a class of 'celluar automata' called the Packard Snowflake.
If you look in the packard_snowflakes directory of this repository, you'll find photographs of the first eight steps of the snowflake.

Write a program to print out a mathematical snowflake.
Take a number on the command line which is the number of generations to run, and then output it to the terminal.
Hint; you can use the â–ˆ character to represent a colored-in square.

Is that too easy? Bonus points available:

    Save the snowflake to a PGM file, as above.
    Use the Blessed library to print the snowflakes out in different colors.
    Use Blessed, and animate the printing of the snowflake;
    print out the first generation, wait a second, print the next generation, wait, print the next...
    Save the snowflake as a PPM file; i.e. the color version of PGM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm
    Look up 'cellular automata'. Do you see any famous examples you recognize?
    Do you see similarities between that and the snowflakes?
    Could you generalize your program to produce both?
